            Hosts open their homes to guests who are looking to enjoy some tasty
            local grub. Invitees can round up friends to join in on the meal or
            arrive solo and meet cool new people at the dinner table. Guests are
            encouraged to bring a gift to the host, or chip in with a suggested
            amount of money.
